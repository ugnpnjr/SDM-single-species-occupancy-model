# R script and data to run single species occupancy model

The script uses detection/non-detection data to run a single-species, single-season occupancy model (MacKenzie et al., 2002, https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/0012-9658%282002%29083%5B2248%3AESORWD%5D2.0.CO%3B2).
I have not uploaded data because the raster files required to produce species distribution maps are heavy and GitHub doesn't allow files larger than 25MB.
Please contact ugyenpenjor.bt@gmail.com to get a copy of the data. 
The codes are annotated for readability. This model uses the Bayesian approach.
If you are interested to learn the same model under the maximum likelihood framework (*and to correct for spatial autocorrelation under the Bayesian framework*), please contact the author.
