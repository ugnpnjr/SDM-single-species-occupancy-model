# SDM-single-species-occupancy-model

The script uses detection/non-detection data to run single-sepcies, single season occupancy model (MacKenzie et al., 2002).
I have not uploaded data because the raster files required to produce species distribution map are heavy and GitHub doesn't allow files larger than 25mb.
Please contact ugyenpenjor.bt@gmail.com to get a copy of the data. 
The codes are annotated for readability. If you did not understand anything, please contact me in the above email address.
